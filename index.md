# The Transparent Nordic Model (NordicT)
The Nordic Transparency Model (NordicT) is a model of the Nordic Electrical Power System built on all found available transparency sources.
Following the EU ... ..., also referred to as the Transparency Act, all TSOs are obliged to deliver a set off data to be made accessable on the Entsoe Transparency Platform. In addition, TSOs are also making data on system topology and operations available on their own open data platforms. 

This projects aim is to gather all available transparency data into one true, highly detailed Nordic Transparency Model to be used as the base-case system state model.

**All varioius transparent open data sources has been implemented into one interactive map as seen below, for all convenience.**

# The Nordic Transparency Model for Analysis
The Nordic Transparency Model for Analysis, **Nordic-T for short**, is an open open research model of the Nordic Electrical Power System built on high accuracy, transparent sources gathered from its Transmission System Operators: Fingrid - Finland, Energinet - Denmark, Statnett - Norway and Svenska kraftnÃ¤t - Sweden. 

It is created as part of the research project at NTNU.

This projects aim is to gather all available transparency data into one true, highly detailed Nordic Transparency Model to be used as the base-case system state model.

**All varioius transparent open data sources has been implemented into one interactive map as seen below, for all convenience.**

### Raw-Transparency Map

This map collects and combines the models transparent network sources into one; raw data map display. Zooming closely inn on Norway and Finland enables their networks full contents.

## Analysis Map

Utilizing the open source [PandaPower](https://www.pandapower.org/) open source power system modelling tool, initial solutions for the models linearized power flows solutions is seen in this analysis map.

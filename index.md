# The Nordic Transparency Model for Analysis
The Nordic Transparency Model for Analysis-project is working towards an open researchers model of the Nordic Electrical Power System being built on available transparent data, published by the Nordic Transmission System Operators(TSOs); *Fingrid - Finland, Energinet - Denmark, Statnett - Norway and Svenska kraftn√§t - Sweden, and ENTSO-E.*

Starting as a M.Sc. project reasearching the use of transparency in dynamic modelling og the Nordic Electrical Power System, this work is included and continued at this projects repository [here](https://github.com/ocrj/Nordic-T).

Below showcases the models consepts and initial overview in maps.


## The Nordic-t Modelling Maps

### The Nordic Transparency Networks

This model representation is simply the transparent, raw network representations as found in the transparent sources, combined into one simple model map display. Zooming closely inn on Norway and Finland reveals their networks full contents.

## The Nordic Transparency States

Through this projects built applications, transparency data on the Nordic operating state is directly linked, and accessable for analysis case modelling. Processing the transparency data a main source, the Entso-E transparency model, reveals the systems operational state as shown in this map.
